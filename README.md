If you receive a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) in California (CA), you must attend a DUI program. The CA Department of Human Services provides a PDF of DUI providers (http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/individuals/Pages/ProviderDirectory-DUI.aspx), but using this may be cumbersome. The HDMA Center collaborates with Prof. Sheldon Wong at SDSU and the CA Department of Human Service to create a Web application to visualize and map DUI providers in CA. Users can go directly to http://vision.sdsu.edu/dui/ to check and search for DUI providers.

The Web application is powered by jQuery, Bootstrap, Leaflet API, and Google Fusion Tables. Please visit the Web application at http://vision.sdsu.edu/dui/
